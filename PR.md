## Add AGENTS instructions

Adds AGENTS.md to version control so the project rules are distributed with the repo. This ensures consistent guidance across worktrees.

Examples (illustrative):

- New contributors can read AGENTS.md immediately.
- Tooling can rely on a committed rules file.

## Changelog

- Add AGENTS.md to the repository root

## Tests

- Not run (documentation-only change)
