## Clarify intg push policy

Documents that `intg` is the integration branch and must not be pushed to `upstream/main`. Clarifies that PRs are created only from `./preq/*` worktrees.

Examples (illustrative):

- Prevents accidental pushes from `intg` to upstream.
- Reinforces PR workflow from `./preq/*`.

## Changelog

- Clarify push policy for `intg` and PR source worktrees

## Tests

- Not run (documentation-only change)
